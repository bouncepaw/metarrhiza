On top of every page, there's a header with links shown. These links are called [[feature/header links | header links]]. You can configure them.

By default, it links to:
* Home [[/]]
* Recent changes [[/recent-changes]]
* List of all hypha [[/list]]
* Random hypha [[/random]]

In order to configure it, you have to list all the links in a special hypha in this format:
```
=> Link1 Displayed text 1
=> Link2 Displayed text 2
```

That's it, simple rocket links. Links can be internal or external. All other lines are ignored, so you can write some explaining text about the hypha for the readers.

An administrator of a wiki has to set what this hypha is. Set in the config:
```ini
...
[Hyphae]
...
HeaderLinksHypha = header_links
...
```

⚠️ If you don't set it, the links can't be configured.

After editing that hypha, update the links by visiting [[/update-header-links]]. On wikis with authorization, only moderators and administrators can do this.

## Example
```myco
This hypha sets what links are shown in the header. Be careful when editing it.
=> home MyWiki
=> /recent-changes What's going on
=> https://example.org Main site
```
