* [[./header | How to configure the navigational header]]

Since the [[release/1.0 | 1.0 release]], wiki administrators are able to configure their wikis using special configuration files. These files will have more capabilities and will be quite convenient to use.

The config file should be named `config.ini`. It is written in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file|.ini format]]. Since the [[release/1.2 | 1.2 release]], the config file is created automatically and placed inside the wiki directory. Here's an example configuration:

```ini
WikiName = My wiki
NaviTitleIcon = üêë

[Hyphae]
HomeHypha = home
UserHypha = u
HeaderLinksHypha = header-links

[Network]
ListenAddr = 0.0.0.0:8080
URL = https://wiki

[Authorization]
UseAuth = true
AllowRegistration = true
```

See [[./fields]] for detailed descriptions of all config file fields.
