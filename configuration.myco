* [[./header | How to configure the navigational header]]

Since the 1.0 release, wiki administrators are able to configure their wikis using special configuration files. These files will have more capabilities and will be quite convenient to use.

The file is written in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file|.ini format]]. Here's an example configuration:

```ini
WikiName = My wiki
NaviTitleIcon = üêë

[Hyphae]
HomeHypha = home
UserHypha = u
HeaderLinksHypha = header-links

[Network]
HTTPPort = 8080
URL = https://wiki
GeminiCertificatePath = /home/wiki/gemcerts

[Authorization]
UseFixedAuth = true
FixedAuthCredentialsPath = /home/wiki/mycocredentials.json
```

See [[./fields]] for detailed descriptions of all config file fields.

You can get an example configuration by running `mycorrhiza -print-example-config`.
