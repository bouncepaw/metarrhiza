**Fediverse** is a union of different federated services like social networks, video hostings, etc running different protocols. According to [[https://the-federation.info]], there are 48 projects in the network running 14 different protocols on more than 8000 nodes.

## ActivityPub
ActivityPub is the most popular protocol in the Fediverse. I'm thinking about implementing some form of support for it, thus joining every public Mycorrhiza wiki into the federation, at least partially.

See [[https://communitywiki.org/wiki/ActivityPub|ActivityPub]] at CommunityWiki for some discussion on the topic.

Read [[https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/|ActivityPub specification]].

## Federated wiki
So, how can the idea of federated wikis be carried out?

### Authorization
Perhaps, profiles from some federated networks could be used for editing Mycorrhiza wikis?

### Notifying about new content
One could subscribe to notifications about new edits instead of looking at the [[feature/feeds]]. Also, wiki admins could set up Fediverse accounts that just broadcast all changes to the world.

### Importing content
MycorrhizaWiki will support importing content from different sources. The Fediverse could be one of them. Imagine [[feature/transclusion|transcluding]] a toot from Mastodon!

### Exporting content
Not exactly sure.

### Commenting
Comment threads from the Fediverse could be shown below or nearby every hypha.

## Webmention
Webmention is another protocol in the Fediverse.

Read [[https://indieweb.org/Webmention|this Indieweb wiki article]] and [[https://indieweb.org/Webmention-developer|this one too]]. I think it's just perfect for cross-site backlinks (it could even be that implementing cross-site backlinks could be easier than in-site backlinks ðŸ¤”). It's also used for commenting.

I like it too. I'm thinking about supporting it in MycorrhizaWiki. Should I support together with ActivityPub or choose just one?
