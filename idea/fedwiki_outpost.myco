During 2021-06-16 FedWiki meeting, Ward and David came up with the idea of Mycorrhiza being an outpost of the FedWiki federation.

FedWiki community calls sites that can share their pages with the federation without running the FedWiki software themselves //outposts//.

FedWiki has a special JSON-based format which seems simple enough for the [[Mycomarkup]] library to produce eventually.

Perhaps, Mycorrhiza will join this federation one day.
