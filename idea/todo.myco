Some form of TODO elements is desired.

## Discussion
A translated ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡ºâž¡ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ discussion from [[https://t.me/mycorrhizadev/6992|our Telegram chat]]:

**Bouncepaw:** [[https://github.github.com/gfm/|GFM]] has an interesting syntax for TODO:
```md
* [ ] todo 1
* [ ] todo 2
```
Interesting ðŸ¤”

**Gualse:** Oh, yes yes

**Bouncepaw:** How could that be incorporated into mycomarkup?

**Gualse:** I want it to be like that: you can click on it and it gets saved.

**Bouncepaw:** That's possible.

**Gualse:** I think that should be optional. On a public wiki, it shouldn't be enabled because someone may click on it accidentally. On a home wiki, though, that'd be great.

## Possible syntax
GFM-like:
```myco
* [ ] todo 1
* [x] todo 2
```

Power of UNICODE, variant 1 (no nesting):
```myco
âœ— todo 1
âœ“ todo 2
```

Power of UNICODE, variant 2:
```myco
* âœ— todo 1
* âœ“ todo 2
```

`todo` block:
```myco
todo Our goals {
x Reach the stars
v Enjoy
}
```
