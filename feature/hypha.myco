Hyphae are what content units called like in MycorrhizaWiki. It usually is an attachment (image, video, etc) with text description or a text note, article, etc.

## Hypha names
Hypha names are case-insensitive. It means that names `amanita muscaria` and `Amanita Muscaria` are same. Also, space and underscore are also the same. Canonical names are all lowercased and have underscores. These are links to the same hypha:
=> test_page
=> Test_page
=> Test_Page
=> TEST_PAGE
=> test%20page

There are some characters that cannot be part of a hypha name: `?!:#@><*|"\'&%{}` Others can be used.

If a hypha has a slash in its name, the hypha is a subhypha of some other hypha. For example, `amanita/muscaria` and `amanita/regalis` are both subhyphae of hypha `amanita`. `Amanita` is not a subhypha of any hypha.

## Text part
Text parts are written in [[mycomarkup]].

### Editing text
When you visit edit-pages of hyphae, you can use the form there. You can also edit files directly if you have access to the wiki server but it's not safe.

## Attachment
Every type of data can be stored as an attachment, but only some of them will render in the browser. Others can still be downloaded.

### Supported image formats
* .jpg
* .gif
* .png
* .webp
* .svg
* .ico
If there's demand on other image formats, they can be added. The problem is that there is no significant support for other image formats in the browsers.

### Supported video formats
* .ogg
* .webm
* .mp4

### Supported audio formats
* .ogg
* .webm
* .mp3

### Uploading attachment
There's a form at end of every page. Once there is an attachment, it can be unattached.

## Storage
All hyphae are stored on file system. Text parts have the `.myco` extension, attachments have any extension they need.

MycorrhizaWiki indexes all those files on start or when `/reindex` is requested by an admin. For every existing hypha there must be a binary file, a text file or both. If there are several binary files for the same hypha, only one of them is used.
