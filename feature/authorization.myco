= Groups
Every user is part of a group. The groups are `anon`, `editor`, `trusted`, `moderator`, `admin`. They have different rights. Anonymous users can only read hyphae, editors can edit hyphae, trusted editors can also rename them, moderators can delete them, and administrators can do everything.
