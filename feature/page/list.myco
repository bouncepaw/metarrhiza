[[/list]] is a page which lists all hyphae on a wiki. The entries are shown in random order. There is a small gray textbox near all hyphae with [[feature/attachment | attachments]] that tells you what kind of attachment it has. This page can also be used for searching the wiki.

The screenshot above shows how the page looks on [[release/1.1]].
