**NB.** This is just an idea. [[]]

We need a column block

= Way 1

```
columns {
  column {
    = Volume 1
    🐟
  }
  column {
    = Volume 2
    🐠
  }
  column {
    = Volume 3
    🐡
  }
}
```

Another way:

```
columns {
  {
    = Volume 1
    🐟
  }
  {
    = Volume 2
    🐠
  }
  {
    = Volume 3
    🐡
  }
}
```

= Way 3
```
column {
  = Volume 1
  🐟
}
column {
  = Volume 2
  🐠
}
column {
  = Volume 3
  🐡
}
```

= Questions
* What about column sizes? Should we be able to set their proportions? Like, the first column is 2fr, the second one is 1fr, like in CSS
* Does `img side` make sense in column blocks?
