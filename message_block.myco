**NB.** This is just an idea.

Wikis encourage communication, right? They do not. Not Mycorrhiza, at least.

A way to solve it is the Message block. I actually had ideas about it for like a year.

Message block should have this:
* Content (Mycomarkup, might be empty)
* Link to author (might be empty)
* Timestamp (might be empty)

Well, we can actually live without timestamps. If you really need them, write them in the content part.

So, content and author. This syntax is reasonable:

```
msg {
  No author
}

msg bouncepaw {
  An author is specified. When rendered, [[u/bouncepaw]] is linked there.
}
```

They can be nested, encouraging branching discussion:

```
msg A { I hate the AC.
  msg B { Why? This is stupid!!
}}

msg B {
   Hello world! Did you know there are many benefits to loving the AC?

   msg C {
      No, I wouldn't have thought! Tell us more please
   }
}
```

Message blocks should look like chat bubbles ðŸ’¬ I am still unsure how to determine what messages go to the left and what messages go to the right.

[[u/drcheems]] and [[u/bouncepaw]] once thought that a multiline `quote {}` block would be nice. I don't think it makes sense to have both `msg {}` and `quote {}` together.
