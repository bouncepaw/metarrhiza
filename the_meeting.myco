**MycoMeet** is a monthly Mycorrhiza Wiki meeting.

There's [[https://communitywiki.org/wiki/WikiMeet | WikiMeet]] at [[https://communitywiki.org | CommunityWiki]] which is a regular meeting with no specific topic but usually devoted to wiki and information organization discussions. However, there's still no Mycorrhiza Wiki meeting. Thereby, I ([[u/DrCheems]]) propose one.
