Here be a **roadmap** of the features. Let's see if it works. We also have a Kanban board and an issue tracker but [[u/bouncepaw]] wants a roadmap anyway.

## How to use
Make every entry a todo list item. Mark with `*v` if the task is done and will be part of the next release. Mark with `*x` otherwise.

Put dependent tasks as sublists. If a task depends on multiple tasks, put it under one of them.
