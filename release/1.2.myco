= Changes
== The Structure
Before this release, you could just run Mycorrhiza on any git repo and get a working wiki. If you wanted any other files, beside the wiki contents, such as configs or user storage, you had to specify them explicitly.

Now you don't. There is a fixed structure of wiki directories that every Mycorrhiza wiki has to follow. It makes both initial deployment and administration easier.

++If you were using an older version of Mycorrhiza, you will have to [[./migration guide | migrate]] to the Structure!++

== [[Mycomarkup]] changes
* Mycomarkup is now being developed as a parallel project â€” [[https://github.com/bouncepaw/mycomarkup]]. A CLI interface is provided as well as a library. This way, you can include it in your projects. For now, this library is less stable than Mycorrhiza itself.
* Transclusion syntax changed dramatically.
* Supertext syntax changed from `^` to `^\^`.
* Highligh syntax changed from `!!` to `+\+`.
* Underline syntax added: `_\_`.
* {
> Quotes
>
> can span multiple paragraphs
> * and any markup inside
}
* { Similarly,

list items can be multiline.

}}
