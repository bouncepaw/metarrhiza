**Mycorrhiza Wiki 1.2** is the third release of Mycorrhiza Wiki. It was released on 2021-07-01, two months after [[../1.1]]. It is a breaking release, see [[./migration guide]].

## Changes
### The Structure
Before this release, you could just run Mycorrhiza on any git repo and get a working wiki. If you wanted any other files, beside the wiki contents, such as configs or user storage, you had to specify them explicitly.

Now you don't. There is a fixed Structure of wiki directories that every Mycorrhiza wiki has to follow. It makes initial deployment for primitive wikis a little bit harder but eases administration a lot for everyone.

++If you were using an older version of Mycorrhiza, you will have to [[./migration guide | migrate]] to the Structure!++

See [[feature/the Structure]].

### [[Mycomarkup]] changes
* Mycomarkup is now being developed as a parallel project â€” [[https://github.com/bouncepaw/mycomarkup]]. A CLI interface is provided as well as a library. This way, you can include it in your projects. For now, this library is less stable than Mycorrhiza itself.
* Supertext syntax changed from `^` to `^^`.
* Highligh syntax changed from `!!` to `++`.
* Underline syntax added: `__`.
* {
> Quotes
>
> can contain multiple paragraphs
> * and any markup inside
}
* { Similarly,

list items can be multiline.

table {
{ the same applies

to table cells } | See this hypha's source to learn how to do so
}}
* In HTML, elements have different ID attributes.

### Editor changes
* There is a new button on the [[feature/tool bar | tool bar]] that inserts current UTC time.
* Underline button.
* You can describe your changes; the message will be shown in history.

### Authorization changes
* If you are not logged in, there is the //Register// link beside the //Login// link.
* ++Fixed authorization is deprecated.++
** The engine will attempt to turn all of your fixed users to registered users.
* There is a panel that lets wiki administrators manage users, i.e. change their groups.
* Users' registration date is saved now.

### Visual changes
* Dark theme improvements
* The background pattern has been removed.
* The [[feature/top bar | top bar]] has changed its color to a brighter one.

   ./non-existent notice before { Before }
   ./non-existent notice after { After }
}}
* Quotes have become cuter.
* The design has become more consistent in some places, less consistent in others.

### History changes

### Various
* The [[essay/name | name]] of the project has been changed from //MycorrhizaWiki// to //Mycorrhiza Wiki//.

* [[/]] no longer redirects to the home hypha, it just shows it, resulting in a better-looking URL.
