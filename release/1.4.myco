## Changes
* The old tabbed layout of hyphae was removed. Now, there is an //Edit// button beside the hypha title (if you have the privileges for doing so). The rest of the functions are located below the hypha content, displayed as simple gray links.
** Additionally, arrow buttons were added for simpler jumping between top and bottom of the page.
* Stopped using PT Sans, use browser's default sans-serif font.
* The gap between lines in the editor is bigger.
* The search results are now sorted.
