Mycorrhiza uses Git, but you're free to replace the executable Mycorrhiza uses with a shim that does nothing, such as `/bin/true`. Assuming it's in `$HOME/bin` and named `git`, you can run Mycorrhiza with a custom `PATH`:
```
$ PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH mycorrhiza path/to/wiki
```
It'll pick up the shim and use it instead of the original Git binary.
