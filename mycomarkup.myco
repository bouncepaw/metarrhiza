**Mycomarkup** is the markup language designed for Mycorrhiza Wiki.

++This document is being moved to the Mycorrhiza's internal help system. Until it is moved, [[/rev/defdefd/mycomarkup | go here]] to read the markup's description.++

Some syntax parts are described on their own hyphae. Take a look at:
=> ./tables
=> ./link
=> feature/transclusion

## Features

### Links
See [[./link]] for details.
```
=> wikilink
=> wikilink display text
=> name_with_spaces

A paragraph with a link to a [[feature/hypha]], perhaps, with a [[feature/hypha|display text]]. External links are a thing: [[https://example.org]]! Sometimes you can omit the brackets for external links: https://example.org
