Welcome to MycorrhizaWiki!

## Introduction
**MycorrhizaWiki** is an open-source wiki engine developed by [[u/bouncepaw]]. You can follow the development on [[https://github.com/bouncepaw/mycorrhiza|GitHub]] or on [[https://pinophyta.lesarbr.es/bouncepaw/mycorrhiza|a mirror hosted on this server]].

This website is an instance of the engine which runs one of the latest unstable versions.

Here are some features of the engine:
* **No database required**, everything is stored as simple files. It simplifies installation and make it easy to modify the content with other means such as direct file editing.
* **Everything is hyphae.** A [[hypha]] is a unit of content such as a picture, video or a text article. Hyphae can [[transclusion|transclude]] and [[link|link]] each other resulting in a tight network of hypertext pages.
* **Nesting of hyphae** is also supported. There is also a tree of related hyphae displayed on every page.
* **History of changes** for text parts of hyphae. Every change is saved to [[git]], the most popular version control system.
* **[[Mycomarkup]], a custom-made markup language.**
* **Optional basic [[authorization]].**
* **[[Opengraph]] support.**
