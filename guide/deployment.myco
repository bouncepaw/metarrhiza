Deploying a Mycorrhiza wiki is simple.

The rest of the instruction assumes you're using a UNIX-compatible operating system such as macOS or a distribution of GNU+Linux. If you're using Windows or any other obscure system, good luck, no one bears the knowledge of using Mycorrhiza on them. The process will be similar though.

## Building
You can build Mycorrhiza by yourself. If you do not want to, just grab a build of any [[release]] you like.

### Runtime dependencies
Mycorrhiza Wiki depends on several other programs in order to work.

#### Go
Go is a compiled programming language Mycorrhiza Wiki is written in. You need a recent version of Go installed. Get it at [[https://golang.org/dl/|Go's website]]. Using your OS's repositories is not recommended because they may be out-of-date.

#### Git
Git is the most popular version control system. You probably have it installed. If not, consult your OS' repos or download from [[https://git-scm.com/downloads|Git website]].

#### Quicktemplate
[[https://github.com/valyala/quicktemplate | Quicktemplate]] is a system Mycorrhiza Wiki uses during compilation. If you have a properly configured Go environment, it will be installed automatically and you will not need to think about it. Don't forget to put `$GOPATH/bin` into your `$PATH`.

### Getting the source code
Visit the [[https://github.com/bouncepaw/mycorrhiza|GitHub repository]]

You can download a .zip archive by clicking Code Â» Download ZIP or use this command (recommended):
```sh
git clone https://github.com/bouncepaw/mycorrhiza
```

Either way, you should end up with a folder full of .go files. Let's assume it is located at `~/src/mycorrhiza`.

### Starting
Run `make build`. You will end up with an executable named `mycorrhiza`. This is the program you need.

If you have downloaded the snapshot, you can just run `make run` and have a running wiki on this address (it is also available in your local network but with a different address):

=> http://localhost:1737

## Installing
If you use linux disto with pacman package manager (Arch, Manjaro, Garuda, etc) you can install it from PKGBUILD:
```sh
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bouncepaw/mycorrhiza/master/PKGBUILD
$ makepkg --install
```

### Creating a wiki
*. Create a directory named, for example, `wiki`.
*. Navigate to the directory and run `git init`. The wiki won't work without that.
*. If you are planning to have hyphae named with unicode characters, also run that: `git config core.quotepath false`. You may not need to run that, depending on your environment configuration.

## Running
To start a wiki, run:
```sh
~/src/mycorrhiza/mycorrhiza ~/path/to/your/wiki
```

Of course, you can move the `mycorrhiza` file anywhere. Your wiki can also be anywhere.

Run this command to see a short summary of [[configuration]] options:
```sh
~/src/mycorrhiza/mycorrhiza -help
```

Make sure that environment variable `$XDG_DATA_HOME` is set to a reasonable location. The recommended value is `$HOME/.local/share`. If you don't set it, the Mycorrhiza will probably figure everything out but it may fail.

### What wiki folders should look like?
You can just base of the default wiki, `metarrhiza`. This way, you will have handy help built-in. The other option is to run the wiki on an empty repo. An interesting option is to run the wiki on any of your image collections. They'll appear as hyphae!

If you have a subfolder called `static`, you can customize the wiki behaviour. File `static/favicon.ico` is used as a favicon for the site. File `static/common.css` can be used to override default styles. Both are optional.
