Mycorrhiza uses Git, but you're free to replace the executable Mycorrhiza uses with a shim that does nothing, like [[contrib/no git | this one]]. Assuming it's in `$HOME/bin`, you can run Mycorrhiza like this:
```
$ PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH mycorrhiza path/to/wiki
```
It'll pick up the shim and use it instead of the original Git binary.
