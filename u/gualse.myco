MycorrhizaWiki contributor. I'm trying to translate wiki to Russian. Also I offer some ideas. Codding is my hobby but I rarely code Mycorrhiza because I don't know Golang and I have little time. My nickname reads as /gualse/ for IPA but I donâ€™t find fault with the pronunciation. Pronoun is `They` but `He` also allowed.

I rarely check other places. If you do not have any of the above, you can write on gualse dot mail at yandex dot com.
