MycorrhizaWiki contributor. ~~I'm trying to translate this wiki to Russian.~~ (I don't translate anymore) Also I offer some ideas. Codding is my hobby but I rarely code Mycorrhiza because I don't know Golang and I have little time. My nickname reads as /gualse/ for IPA but I donâ€™t find fault with the pronunciation. Pronouns as you wish but `They` is preffered.

I rarely check other places. If you do not have any of the above, you can write on gualse dot mail at yandex dot com.
