By default, Mycorrhiza Wiki has no protection nor authorization, thus anyone who has access to your wiki can edit. You may want to turn on authorization.

= Groups
Every user is part of a group. The groups are `anon`, `editor`, `trusted`, `moderator`, `admin`. They have different rights. Anonymous users can only read hyphae, editors can edit hyphae, trusted editors can also rename them, moderators can delete them, and administrators can do everything.

= Additional authorization techniques
[[Basic Auth]] is provided by most web servers. You will probably want to use one for HTTPS, so you might as well consider using it, if you don't like Mycorrhiza's approach to authorization.

There is a fork of Mycorrhiza with built-in support for Tailscale:
