One of the aims MycorrhizaWiki has, is **integration**, //id est// you are meant to be able to somehow stick the wiki together with other software and get things done, hence the name.

See [[Recipes]] for some stuff you can do.
See [[Idea]] for planned features.

### Network
MycorrhizaWiki does not do all the network stuff by design. If you need some advanced stuff, use `nginx` or any other web server.

There are recipes such as [[recipes/how to set up HTTPS]] and [[recipes/basic auth]] that offer you to use nginx.

### Direct file operations
Wiki administrators that have direct access to the wiki files can do stuff with `git` and other utilities. In fact, they are meant to.
